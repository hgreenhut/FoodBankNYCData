The pantry is open on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9:00am to 11:30am. Mass Distribution occurs on the last Thursday of each month from 8:30am to 11:30am. Every family member must present an ID for each visit, which is limited to once per month. In 2015, the pantry served a record-breaking 47,715 individuals, including 17,588 children, and provided a total of 429,435 meals. These numbers highlight the significant need for temporary and emergency food assistance due to economic, governmental, and individual circumstances.
The pantry also offers several wrap-around services, including the Nutrition Education and Outreach Program, which provides pre-screening and assistance with Food Stamp applications. Nutritionists from Cornell Cooperative Extension and other organizations offer cooking and nutrition classes. Additionally, Experience Works, a training program for seniors, offers employment opportunities.
Mass Distribution is a program started by the SICM Food Pantry in partnership with the Regional Food Bank. On the last Thursday of each month, the RFB delivers 12 pallets of hard-to-move items, such as produce, yogurt, cottage cheese, juice, and bread. Each person receives a box and can take enough of each item based on their family size. The items change monthly, and this program does not count against the person's regular pantry visit. The pantry is closed for regular business on Mass Distribution day, and transportation is not provided.
The SICM Emergency Food Pantry welcomes and appreciates donations of items, particularly those not covered by SNAP benefits and other items. Donations can be dropped off at the Food Pantry located at 839 Albany Street between 7:30am and 2:00pm, Monday through Friday. Donors should drive up to the loading dock at the back of the pantry and ring the doorbell next to the loading dock door. For large donations, please arrange a time through pantry staff by calling 346-4445. Thank you!

Every other Monday from 11:00am to 1:00pm, Bread of Life Ministry provides hope for the hungry in Westchester County. Hunger is a persistent problem in the area, with approximately 200,000 people, or 21% of total residents, hungry or at risk of hunger. One third of those affected are children.
Bread of Life provides food to families, as well as over 17 church and government food pantries and shelters throughout southern Westchester County. These include Open Arms, Grace Church, Hope House, Carver Center, Don Bosco, El Centro Hispanico, Ecumenical Pantry, Saint Peter's Church, Union Baptist Church, White Plains CAP F.P, First Seventh Day Adventist Church, Sister Anne Residence, Samaritan House, St. Frances Church, Allen AME, and the Harrison Food Pantry.
Bread of Life began with one bagel shop owner who wanted to give back to the community by providing bagels for the poor and the hungry. Now, our team partners with local businesses, churches, and government agencies to serve as a bridge to unite supply and demand. We receive food supplies from various sources, including donations from local businesses of excess food that would otherwise be discarded as waste. We get this food into the hands of those who are hungry.
Bread of Life doesn't just supply the hungry with food. We bring the unconditional love of God and the hope in Jesus Christ to those most in need. We thank our wonderful merchant food donors, including Costco, Pizza 2000, Kneaded Bread, Trader Joe's, Al Dente, Planet Pizza, Henri's Bagels, Handrolled Bagels, Le Pain Quotidien, Chipotle, Rye Farmer's Market, Tarry Market, Goldberg's, Rockin Bagel Cafe, and Whole Foods, for giving hope to the hungry.
Bread of Life welcomes both food and financial donations. To arrange a food donation, please call the number listed below. Tax-deductible financial donations to Bread of Life may be made by mail, through our website, or by emailing us to arrange a corporate donation.

The NEBHDCo Golden Harvest Food Pantry is located at 376 Throop Avenue, between Lafayette and Kosciuszko. As a partner agency of New York City Emergency Feeding since 1993, they opened a new supermarket-style food center in June 2014. The storage room on the ground floor includes a demonstration kitchen, a classroom, and a three-position advantages center.
In the six months since the new pantry opened, they have more than doubled the number of families served. They continue to register new families at a rate of 20-30 per class to meet the growing demand. On the pantry floor, customers choose their own food, supermarket-style. Purchases are made per family of 1 to 6 people, once a month. There are more healthy product choices, fresh fruits and vegetables from NEBHDCo's gardens and local farms, and more chilled and frozen products available from units within reach. There is also a refrigerator and walk-in freezer for the preservation of perishable expanded products.",Food bank,ChIJ-aZxQvNbwokRIF5LXRVclDo,FF,,,,,,,,
